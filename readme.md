How to use this app?

- git pull
- Before getting started on this assignment, we’ll need to register for an API key in order to be able to query IEX’s data. To do so, follow these steps:

    - Visit iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/.
    - Select the “Individual” account type, then enter your name, email address, and a password, and click “Create account”.
    - Once registered, scroll down to “Get started for free” and click “Select Start plan” to choose the free plan. Note that this plan only works for 30 days from the day you create your account. Keep this in mind if you might plan to use this same API for your final project!
    - Once you’ve confirmed your account via a confirmation email, visit https://iexcloud.io/console/tokens.
    - Copy the key that appears under the Token column (it should begin with pk_).
    - In your terminal window, execute:
    - $ export API_KEY=value

- flask run
